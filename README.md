# Tabs Component

## Overview
This project implements a tab-based navigation system for selecting different meal plans. The tabs dynamically change content using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Each tab displays a different meal plan with an associated image and description.

## Features
- Dynamic tab switching
- Smooth UI with CSS transitions
- JavaScript event handling for seamless interactions
- Responsive layout

## File Structure
```
├── index.html     # Main HTML structure
├── style.css      # Styling for the tabs component
├── script.js      # JavaScript logic for tab functionality
└── img           # Folder containing images for meal plans
```

## How It Works
1. The HTML structure consists of:
   - A section for displaying the meal plans.
   - A header containing navigation buttons for switching between different meal plans.
2. The JavaScript logic handles:
   - Hiding all tab contents initially.
   - Displaying the selected tab's content when its corresponding button is clicked.
   - Updating the active tab styling dynamically.
3. The CSS ensures:
   - Proper layout and spacing of elements.
   - Hidden tab content is displayed only when active.
   
## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Click on different tabs to switch between meal plans.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)

## Future Improvements
- Add smooth fade-in/out transitions between tabs.
- Improve responsiveness for mobile devices.
